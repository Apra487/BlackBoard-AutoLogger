## BlackBoard auto login

A `nodejs` based application that automatically logs in into your accounts and attends your classes on `cuchd.blackboard.com` website.
I wrote this script STRICTLY for EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES and I am NOT RESPONSIBLE for any **non-disciplinary** action commited by its users.

## Motivation
