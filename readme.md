# BlackBoard auto login

A nodejs based application that automatically logs in into your accounts and attends your classes on `cuchd.blackboard.com` website. I wrote this script STRICTLY for EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES and I am NOT RESPONSIBLE for any **non-disciplinary** action commited by its users, i.e., all the students of Chandigarh University

With that being said, let's get right into it, shall we ?
